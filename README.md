# Tinder-Bumble_auto_like_2021
All previous JS solutions for auto swiping won't work as Click class has been gone (Most likely to prevent auto-swiping)
This handles issue with that by hardcoding xPath to click button for both Tinder and Bumble.
Hopefully they won't change their website CSS too often. 
Cheers.
