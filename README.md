# Tinder-Bumble_auto_like_2021
All previous JS solutions for auto swiping won't work as Click class has been gone (Most likely to prevent auto-swiping)
This handles issue with that by hardcoding xPath to click button for both Tinder and Bumble.
Hopefully they won't change their website CSS too often. 
Cheers. 

How to
- 1. Copy the js script
- 2. Paste it into developer console
- 3. Fetch Button's xPath by clicking the asset https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3030487/is-there-a-way-to-get-the-xpath-in-google-chrome
- 4. Run the script and answer to prompts
- 5. Cheers
